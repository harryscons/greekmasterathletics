## Recent Accomplishments (v2.15.004 - v2.15.014)

### 🏆 Rankings Tab
- Added a new "Rankings" sub-tab to the Statistics section.
- Implemented WMA performance aggregation per athlete (Best/Avg Pts, Record Count).
- Added medal icons (🥇🥈🥉) and sortable headers with live sort direction arrows.
- Implemented polling retry logic to ensure WMA scoring data is ready before rendering.

### 📊 WMA Calculation & UI Refinement
- **Track & Road Decimal Fix**: Updated `calculateRateConv` so marks like `14.9` are correctly interpreted as `14.90` (tenths/hundredths) for both **Track** and **Road** events.
- **Age Mark Formatting**: The "Age Mark" in WMA Statistics reports is now formatted as a **time string** (e.g., `3:49.68`) for all Track and Road events.
- **Improved Sorting**: Enhanced the `getNumeric` helper to correctly parse formatted time strings, ensuring "Age Mark" sorting remains accurate.
- **Default Sorting**: Changed the WMA Statistics report default sort order to **Pts** (Points) descending.
- **Label Rename**: Renamed **"Medal Statistics"** to **"National Holder Statistics"**.

### 🛠️ Stability & Performance
- Integrated `getExactAge()` for consistent DOB parsing across all Statistics views.
- Switched to `athleteLookupMap` for faster performance.
